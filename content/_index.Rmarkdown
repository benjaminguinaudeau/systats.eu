Started with a B.A. in social sciences I have been interested in measuring all kind of social processes. Therefore I am graduating in empirical political research focusing on bridging the gap between normative political theory and data evidence. At the moment I work as a Data Scientist at a start up business called Paraboost. The next step will be hopefully a PhD in computational social sciences at the university of Konstanz (Germany). In the following you find a short overview of my research interests ...

              Combining interesting research questions about human behavoir and socital dynamics with statistics and machine learning is never boring but enlightening ðŸ’¡ In 2018 I started to investigate Alt-Right radicalization on social media and terrorism informatics thanks to VOX-Pol.
