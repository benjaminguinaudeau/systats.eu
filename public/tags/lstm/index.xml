      <description>Todayâ€™s tutorial will cover how to perform text classification with keras (build on top of tensorflow). This is a fairly new but incrediable experience for R users who have been limited in the past to more high level machine learning liberaries like caret and h2o. These packages are great for a varity of machine learning tasts by the magic ensemble learning and hyperparameter grid search infrastructure from h2o. Despite some good feed forward networks, natural language or computer vision tasks require more complex network archetectures to learn informativ low dimensional features.</description>
