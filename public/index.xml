      <description>Todayâ€™s tutorial will cover how to perform text classification with keras (build on top of tensorflow). This is a fairly new but incredible experience for R users who have been limited in the past to more high level machine learning libraries like caret and h2o. These packages are great for a variety of machine learning tasks by the magic ensemble learning and hyperparameter grid search infrastructure from h2o. Despite some good feed forward networks, natural language or computer vision tasks require more complex network architectures to learn informative low dimensional features.</description>

      <title>R Squared Simulations</title>

      <description>The model performance measure \(R^2\) is often subject to fierce criticism for being prone to its context. This notebook describes some well known criticism of \(R^2\) and tests the deficiencies by simulations. By combining theory, code and accessible graphics I want to show the implications for getting any useful information from \(R^2\).
Literature The theoretical considerations are partly taken from
 The Elements of Statistical Learning p.14-16 Urban and Mayerl (2011) set up a poison list of 10 items to be considered, as \(R^2\) is artificially biased by other parameters.</description>

      <description>Hi my name is Simon Roth and I am a social data scientist. Started with a B.A. in social sciences I have been deeply interested in measuring social processes. Therefore I am graduating in empirical political research focusing on bridging the gap between normative political theory and data evidence. Hopefully a PhD in computational social sciences will be the next step.
In the past two years a got in applied machine learning for text mining projects.</description>

&amp;mdash; Jeff Leek (@jtleek) April 12, 2017  XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book.</description>
