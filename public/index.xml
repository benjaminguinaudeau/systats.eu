      <title>Text Classification in R</title>

      <description>Todayâ€™s tutorial will cover how to perform text classification with keras (build on top of tensorflow). This is a fairly new but incredible experience for R users who have been limited in the past to more high level machine learning libraries like caret and h2o. These packages are great for a variety of machine learning tasks by the magic ensemble learning and hyperparameter grid search infrastructure from h2o. Despite some good feed forward networks, natural language or computer vision tasks require more complex network architectures to learn informative low dimensional features.</description>

      <title>R Squared Simulations</title>

      <description>The model performance measure \(R^2\) is often subject to fierce criticism for being prone to its context. This notebook describes some well known criticism of \(R^2\) and tests the deficiencies by simulations. By combining theory, code and accessible graphics I want to show the implications for getting any useful information from \(R^2\).
Literature The theoretical considerations are partly taken from
 The Elements of Statistical Learning p.14-16 Urban and Mayerl (2011) set up a poison list of 10 items to be considered, as \(R^2\) is artificially biased by other parameters.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
