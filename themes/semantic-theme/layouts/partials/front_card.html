    I'm a first year PhD student at the Graduate School of Decision Sciences (GSDS) from the University of Konstanz. My research interests include political extremism and hate speech which will be updated soon. Additionally, I'am working as a junior data scientist at Paraboost and Lovai. My last projects were build upon methods from Natural Language Processing, machine learning and web development. Every day I use R, occasionally blog about it and organize from time to time workshops.
